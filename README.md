# What's Bingbon-Helper?
A helper that brings you back to the shore.

# Why Bingbon-Helper?
Currently, Bingbon Exchange's web is quite simple and easy to use. But it lacks of some funtionalities/features that would make it better. This helper, in form of a Chrome extension, will help you on that. And maybe more...

# How to install
I recommend you to install this using Google's Chrome Web Store, at: <to be updated>.  
  You can download zip file from: https://github.com/lvdiev/Bingbon-Helper/releases and install it manually.

# What does it have so far?
## Display current price on title
The original title is just a static text "Bingbon" that tells you where we are, but we all know it. What we want to know is the current price and symbol, like almost exchange's show.
## Display current spread on Long/Short button
Low fee comes with high spread is a problem of Bingbon. Anyway, we still accept them. So let's display it on the buttons and we will know how it's going.
## Move Pagination up
The original Pagination (the buttons Previous|Next on tables) is at the bottom of tables. It's will be easier to find now when moved up.
## Blur the VST records
It will filter out the VST records on History/Order/Trigger tables and blur them. You now can focus on USDT clearly.
## Narrow the Latest Trade
This tab is not so important, but it takes some pixels that would make the important tables look not good. So I narrowed it.

# What's next?
I'm working on it to add some more funtionalities. You are welcome to fork and submit the merge request or issue.
