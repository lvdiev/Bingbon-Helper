# Why Bingbon-Helper?
Currently, Bingbon Exchange's web is quite simple and easy to use. But it lacks of some funtionalities/features and may help you master your deals. This helper (in form of a Chrome extension) will help you on that. And maybe more...

# What does it have so far?
## +Display current price on title
The original title is just a static text "Bingbon" that tells you where we are, but we all know it. What we want to know is the current price and symbol, like almost exchange's show.
## +Display current spread on Long/Short button
Low fee comes with high spread is a problem of Bingbon. Anyway, we still accept them. So let's display it on the buttons and we will know how it's going.
